# Filta-MinDarc-Mohammad-Amin-Mohammadi
Mohammad-Amin-Mohammadi-Front End Assessment

This program is developed in React.js and TypeScript.
The project is not built for a better resolution of type chack.

You would need to have the latest Node version installed.

After cloning the project you can run the project in three steps:

1-Please direct your command prompt/terminal to the root folder. 
(please make sure your command prompt/terminal is looking at the root folder of this project.)

2-Run following command to install the dependencies (node_modul): yarn install.

3-After installation is done you can start the program on localhost port 3000 using the following command: yarn start.

*****(Use two buttons at landing page (http://localhost:3000/) to navigate to desired assessment.)****
The first page is the landing page I decide to add to the assessment that helps to unitise to sections.

*****Also I have added a back button to internal pages for easier navigation.*****

I have minimized the comments as the project is simple and functions are self-explanatory.

*****Answer to the question ('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase() is banana******

As the empty space responds to a number as fist "+" in the empty space points at adding strings to gather (concatenation) and second "+" represent a positive number, the result, the return will be "NaN" (Not a Number) and adding NaN in lowercase to baNaNa is "banana".

In case of any issues do not hesitate to contact me on my email: mmoh2718@uni.sydney.edu.au.

Thank you for paying me any attention. 

All the bests
